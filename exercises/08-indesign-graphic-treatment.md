## Exercise: Graphic Treatment



**1. Setting up the InDesign Document**

- Create a New InDesign Document with these settings:
  - Letter Size page
  - set units to inches (or mm if you prefer)
  - .5 inch margins
  - uncheck facing pages
- On the Master A page, make a grid (layout->create guides)
  - 6 columns
  - 4 rows
  - gutter of .125 inches
  - fit to: margins
- Select the Type Tool, click and drag to make a text Box for the Title, which will be "[Your Name] Graphic Treatment"
  - choose a "vanilla" sans-serif typeface, set to 36 point type size
- Make three Subheadings, set to 18 point type size
  - Color
  - Typography
  - Texture
- Make 5 squares for Color
- Make 4 Text Boxes for Typography
- Place 3 images for Texture
- Arrange each element on the page, such that 
  - the squares visually belong with Color
  - the text boxes visually belong with Typography
  - the images visually belong with Texture
- Now that we've set up our document and learned how to use grids in InDesign to define spatial zones, we can start specifying our design in each of the three categories of visual literacy
