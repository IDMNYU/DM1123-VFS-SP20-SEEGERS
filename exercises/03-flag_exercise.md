## Class Exercise: Design a Flag

* Post to The Slack channel #exercise-flag-design, an Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file, **remember to name your file lastname, firstname - exercise name.ai**

* Create a new Adobe Illustrator file with an artboard of 3" width and 5" height
* Using your knowledge of vector graphics (fills and strokes, simple shapes, the pathfinder tool) design a flag, any flag
* Keep it abstract and simple!
