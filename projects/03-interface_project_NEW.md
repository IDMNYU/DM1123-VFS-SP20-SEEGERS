# PROJECT 2 & 3 — INTERFACE: MENU
- Using InDesign and Figma, you will design a restaurant menu for print and digital formats.
  - Through this project we will learn hierarchy, grids, type styles, and composition
  - You will come up with the name of your restaurant (if you designed a restaurant logo in the logo project you may use this, or come up with a new one)
  - Everyone's menus will use all of the recipes each of you have contributed, but you will choose how you want to organize the recipes and you will introduce sub-categories of organization (appetizers, mains, desserts)
- First, we will use [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html) to design a menu for Print output on Letter/A4 size paper
- Second, we will use [Figma](figma.com) to design a menu for mobile screen viewing



**Tools we will use in this project:**

- Pen/Pencil & Paper
- Phone scanning apps
  - Genius Scan 
  - Adobe Scan
  - Microsoft Office Lens
- Are.na: Visual research
- InDesign: Composition, layout
- Photoshop: Image processing
- Illustrator: Vector Graphics, icons, and logos
- Figma: Wireframing, Digital Prototyping
- Google Forms: content entry
- Google Sheets: content database repository




## Content Creation & Initial Visual Research

**Part 1. Come up with one dish and one beverage** that is a specialty of where you are currently, whether that is the region or country you are in, or your household. Tap into your creative side and have fun with it! This will be the content everyone will be working with in this project.

  You should have the following elements:

  - Title of Dish (30 characters max)
  - Description of Ingredients as a list (10 words max)
  - Price (include currency)
  - Image of the dish: you can use an image you find online, or take your own photo
  - Beverage Title (30 characters max)
  - Beverage description of Ingredients (5 words max)
  - Price (include currency) 


  Enter this into the form I've created for you here: https://forms.gle/HRen7bxmajHV6tDY7

  - After you enter your information, you can go back and change it, as well as see [everyone else's entries in the collected spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uP1pHQCDkoDJ9SSTXOiCMsuNI7uAsoo_YnzOaS3Q93s/edit?usp=sharing)
  
    

** Part 2. Visual Research using Are.na**: put together an Are.na channel of visual references that relate to menu design, typographic styles, or color palettes

  - go to are.na and sign up for an account with your NYU email address
  - I will invite you to our [private VFS group](https://www.are.na/vfs-sp20)
  - use are.na ([Introduction Tutorial on Are.na here](https://support.are.na/help/can-i-watch-a-tutorial-3b49c282) )to organize visual research in a new channel of your own, titled "[Your Name]'s Menu Research"
    - Menu-specific design: Search and Research online and around you (find print menus if you can!) and explore variations in menu design, adding 10-15 blocks
      - hint: many restaurants have PDF versions of their printed menus on their websites, check out some of your favorite restaurants websites first
    - Expand your visual vocabulary: collect color, typography, and texture references you are inspired by, adding 20-30 blocks

  The free version of are.na is limited to 50 blocks, hence this limit


### [Exercise: Graphic Treatment](exercises/08-indesign-graphic-treatment.md) To be done "in class" on Tuesday, March 31


## Part 1: Print Interface
- establish visual character through a graphic treatment outlining typography, color, and image texture
  - typographic character - choose up to 3 typefaces
  - color palette
  - image treatment, in Photoshop: cropping, processing, texture
- sketch out layout using wireframing technique
- content entry into InDesign
- refine design and layout in InDesign
- Print & Finishing/Folding



### 1st Draft: Establish Hierarchy with Grids and Wireframes
Post a PDF using one of the listed phone-scanning apps to the #project-menu-print Slack channel.

* Example: [Josh Crutchmer blocking out the NYTimes front page](https://twitter.com/jcrutchmer/status/1205667822338265088)
* Create at least 5 hand-drawn wireframes of your menu on A4/Letter size paper using pen/pencil
* Every single element needs to be accounted for including Titles/Headings, subtitle/subheadings, description text, images/graphics, and prices.
* Use graphic conventions as placeholder: Lorem Ipsum for placeholder text, blocks for images at this stage
* Enter all the content into your InDesign File
* Scan using your phone and Genius Scan/Adobe Scan/Microsoft Office Lens, and upload a PDF to #project-interface-menu-print
* **Due Tues, April 7th by beginning of class time**



### 2nd Draft: Design Development

- With all your content entered, create a draft design of your print menu in InDesign.
  * Use Character and Paragraph Styles to speed up changes down the road

* Create 3 different/alternate  versions of your page layout in InDesign, use an iterative process to explore variations on using your grid.
* Export a PDF and upload to #project-interface-menu-print
* **Due for Group A on Tues, April 14**
* **Due for Group B on Thurs, April 16**
* we will have one-on-one crits and break-out room small group crits  



### Print Interface Final: Graphic Tightening and Finalize Design

* Refine design based on feedback from your classmates and the professor as discussed in group critiques and one-on-one desk crits.
*  Export a PDF and upload to #project-interface-menu-final, along with your digital prototype
* ~~Print out your physical menu and bring it in to class~~
* **Due for Group A on Tues, May 5**
* **Due for Group B on Thurs, May 7**  




## Part 2: Digital Screen Interface

#### Digital Interface 1st Draft: Lo-Fidelity Wireframes

- Create a wireframe of your interface for screen viewing using Figma
  - Enter all the content into your Figma canvas
- Every single element needs to be accounted for including Titles/Headings, subtitle/subheadings, description text, images/graphics, and prices.
- Post a Figma Preview link to #project-interface-menu-screen
- **Due Tuesday, April 21**
