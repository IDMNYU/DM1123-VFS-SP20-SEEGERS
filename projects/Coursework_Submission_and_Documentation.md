## IDM COURSEWORK DOCUMENTATION

* We will use Slack as the primary means of submitting assignments, homework, tickets to leave, and for quick feedback. It will also serve as an archive of your work, collectively
* When I invite you to the class Slack, please enter your full first and last name (DO NOT leave it blank or as your netID)

If your work is archived on your personal servers, there is a possibility that you may delete your archives after you  graduate or even sooner.
